		,"\"27Al(n,a) cs were taken from the evaluation EAF-4 of"
		,"that time.Some explanations should be done to this."
		,"1.  In reality, all the cross sections were measured in"
		,"our experiments relatively to the 93Nb(n,2n) c-s (if"
		,"other was not pointed out specially)."
		,"2.  However, this cross section that is very convenient"
		,"for practical use was not evaluated good enough at that"
		,"time."
		,"3.  We decided to improve the data of 93Nb(n,2n) using"
		,"the ratio of 27Al(n,a) to 93Nb(n,2n) cs measured in the"
		,"large body of our experiments. This ratio is shown in"
		,"Fig. 2.2 of ref. RI-252."
		,"4.  The corrected in such a way data of 93Nb(n,2n) were"
		,"finally used as the reference cross section in our"
		,"measurements."
		,"So, in fact, all the data of our measurements are first"
		,"related to the 27Al(n,a) cross section."
		,"However, it would be not quite correctly to write this,"
		,"because Al foils were used often, but not in every"
		,"measurement. In the contrary, the niobium foils were"
		,"used ALWAYS, and namely the 93Nb(n,2n) c-s was used in"
		,"calculations.THE ONE CORRECTED BY US."
		,"This is why the both cross sections, the 27Al(n,a) and"
		,"the 93Nb(n,2n) were given in our works as reference"
		,"ones."
		,"Probably, it would be better to give in the"
		,"corresponding Tables of our works three column:"
		,"1.  The 27Al(n,a) data taken from the evaluation"
		,"2.  The 93Nb(n,2n) to 27Al(n,a) ratio measured by us"
		,"3.  The corrected 93Nb(n,2n) cs that is the result of"

		,"A question concerning the sentence:"
		,">   1.  The 27Al(n,a) data taken from the evaluation."
		,"Does it mean, that all 15 points for Al(n,a) c-s were"
		,"obtained from interpolation of EAF-4 ?"
		,"Or only part of them?"
		,"I ask, because as clearly see on Fig.2.2 of"
		,"R,INDC-CCP-0402 (in attached file; data given for"
		,"Al(n,a) c-s in INDC-CCP-0402 and RI-252 are the same),"
		,"only 9 lower (in En region) points lie directly on"
		,"EAF-4 curve, but for 6 upper (in En) points there are"
		,"some visual deviation from EAF-4."
		,"Could you please comment these deviations from EAF-4 ?"
		,"May be, not all given points were from EAF, but only"
		,"several lower points ?"
		,"And also, we would appreciate greatly, if you could be"
		,"so kind to send us the directly measured ratio"
