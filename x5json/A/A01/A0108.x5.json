		,"fission fragments was detected with a transmission of"

		,"Low-energy fission (E* <25 MeV) events were selected by"
		,"their magnetic rigidity.  Whereas the production of"
		,"asymmetric fission events is dominated by the GQR"
		,"excitation, very asymmetric fission and symmetric"
		,"fission take place after a GQR or DGDR excitation or"
		,"after a nuclear interaction.  Cross sections of more"
		,"than 250 isotopes were measured.  Isotopic"
		,"distributions of low-energy fission were reconstructed"
		,"for elements from Se to Te.  The fission modes SI, SII"
		,"and SL were clearly shown in these distributions and in"
		,"the mass and TKE  distributions.   Charge  polarization"
