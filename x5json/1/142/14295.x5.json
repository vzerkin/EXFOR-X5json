		,"and in holes in the wax two B10F3 neutron counters"
		,"were placed as shown, centered about 9 cm. below the"
		,"uranium. This pile was built on a steel frame, the"
		,"paraffin being contained in light steel tanks so that"
		,"the whole was demountable. A lead absorber could be"
		,"placed on top of the pile up to 25 cm in thickness."
		,"The neutrons which come from one fission event are"
		,"slowed down in the paraffin and with a mean life of"
		,"about 150 microsec will be captured in the paraffin"
		,"or in the boron of the counters. Neutrons recorded in"
		,"a suitable time interval after the nuclear event will"
		,"therefore have a common origin. But because of the"
		,"low efficiency of such an arrangement, only a few of"
		,"the released neutrons will be recorded. The amount of"
		,"uranium (8.05 kg) used was much too small to produce"
		,"a substantial number of thermal-neutron-induced"
		,"fissions in U235 by spontaneous fission neutrons"
		,"slowed down in the paraffin. This was checked by"
		,"surrounding the uranium with cadmium which lowered"
		,"the counting efficiency without producing a"
		,"significant effect on the final results. The"
		,"measurements are considered to apply to U238 since the"
		,"amount of U235 and other isotopes is known to be less"
		,"than 1% and their spontaneous fission rate is too"
		,"small to contribute appreciably."]
