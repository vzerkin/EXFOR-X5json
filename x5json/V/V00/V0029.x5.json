		,"** Principal points of this evaluation"
		," (1.) Simultaneous evaluations, in which a group of"
		,"  cross-sections are considered, together with their"
		,"  correlation."
		," (2.) Ratio of cross sections is employed to avoid the"
		,"  absolute measurement of neutron fluence rate."
		,"  All activation cross-sections are in fact measured as"
		,"  ratios relative to some monitor (standard) cross-"
		,"  sections. All results were firstly adjusted to a"
		,"  neutron energy of 14.70 MeV."
		," (3.) The cross-sections are determined in a known"
		,"  neutron fluence which may be determined either by a"
		,"  proton recoil telescope, or by a plastic scintillator"
		,"  or by the associated particle technique (in case of"
		,"  D-T neutron source). The associated particle"
		,"  technique is absolute."
		," (4.) The mathematical treatment follows that of Hayes"
		,"  and Axton, Metrologia 6(1969)21."
		,"** Results"
		," The results are mostly in agreement within the errors"
		,"  with several other evaluation."
		," The ENDF/B-V ratio of the 2 most commonly used"
		,"  standard cross-sections, Al-27(n,a) and Fe-56(n,p),"
		,"  was 7.5% higher than the ratio of this results."
		,"** Selection of papers"
		," About 70 from more than 100 original papers on"
		,"  activation cross section measurement around 14 MeV"
		,"  have been included in the evaluation(except H(n,n)H)."
		,"  Nearly all papers prior to 1960 were arbitrarily"
		,"  excluded. The following tables shows the out-lines"
		,"  of the data selection, correlation and the results."
