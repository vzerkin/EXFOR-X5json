		," the energy range of dibaryon resonances. The most"

		," is a forward nonpeaking angular distribution. This"
		," behavior is in complete disagreement with the"

		," data for gamma+d -> pi-0+d at large angles show that"
		," the differential cross section decreases"
		," exponentially as a function of pion angle. A"
		," comparison was made with a Glauber model calculation."
		," The result seems to be rather in favor of the"
		," existence of dibaryon resonances, but a clear"
		," conclusion was not possible because of a lack of more"
		," accurate data. In the process gamma+d -> pX, a broad"
