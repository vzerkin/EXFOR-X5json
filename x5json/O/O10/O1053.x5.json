		,"explained in REL-REF, where a more detailed"
		,"description on the corrections applied can be found."
		,"Here only a short reminder is given."
		,"The production rates are only partly corrected for"
		,"secondary reactions inside the production target. It is"
		,"assumed that secondary reactions, which are estimated"
		,"on the basis of the total reaction probability after"
		,"the first reaction, depopulate the nuclides in the"
		,"considered range, whereas the population due to"
		,"secondary reactions is assumed to appear in lighter"
		,"nuclei with Z<74 and could be neglected and is 5%."
		,"The fluctuations within the isotopic distributions are"
		,"rather low. However, a few dips can be observed for"
		,"elements from thorium to astatine. Actually, the very"
		,"short time-of-flight of the ions, 150-ns eigen-time,"
		,"authorises the measurement of the production cross-"
		,"sections for most of the isotopes, namely when the"
		,"radioactive-decay period is much longer than the"
		,"time-of-flight of the ions. Only a few isotopes with"
		,"a number 128 neutrons decay by alpha emission towards"
		,"the 126-neutron shell and cause a dip in the apparent"
		,"cross sections. The decay period of those isotopes is"
		,"order of the TOF through the FRS . Therefore, part of"
		,"the production is lost before being analysed and"
		,"identified. Moreover, when the decay occurs at the very"
		,"beginning of theflight path, the ion is identified as"
		,"the daughter nucleus. This effect causes the slight"
		,"hump that can be observed for At-211 . It is not simple"
		,"to correct for this effect, since many of these nuclei"
		,"might be produced in isomeric states. Moreover, the"
		,"branching ratios and some of the associated decay"
		,"periods are not known. A couple of isotopes with a"
		,"number of 129 neutrons are also concerned. The very"
		,"fast decay of these nuclei, which prevents us from"
		,"giving true cross section in these few cases,"
		,"demonstrates the high quality of our data. This ensures"
		,"that the uncertainty is as low as claimed, since"
		,"effects of 10% to 20% can be observed. Moreover, we"
		,"guarante that the mass and charge identification is"
		,"correct."]
